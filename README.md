# Learning Github
***

## What is Github?

At a high level, [Github][Github] is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code.


## <span style= "Color: Purple">7 Major Benefits of using Github

> 1. **It makes it easy to contribute to your open source projects :** To be honest, nearly every open-source project uses GitHub to manage their project. Using GitHub is free if your project is open source and includes a wiki and issue tracker that makes it easy to include more in-depth documentation and get feedback about your project. If you want to contribute, you just fork a project, make your changes and then send them a pull request using GitHub web interface.
> 2. **Documentation :** By using GitHub, you make it easier to get excellent documentation. Their help section and guides have articles for nearly any topic related to git that you can think of.
> 3. **Markdown :** Markdown allows you to use a simple text editor to write formatted documents. GitHub has revolutionized writing by channeling everything through Markdown: from the issue tracker, user comments, everything. With so many other programming languages to learn for setting up projects, it’s really a big benefit to have your content inputted in a format without having to learn yet another system.
> 4. **GitHub is a repository :** This was already mentioned before, but it’s important to note, GitHub is a repository.
What this means that it allows your work to get out there in front of the public. Moreover, GitHub is one of the largest coding communities around right now, so it’s wide exposure for your project.
> 5. **Track changes in your code across versions :** When multiple people collaborate on a project, it’s hard to keep track revisions—who changed what, when, and where those files are stored. GitHub takes care of this problem by keeping track of all the changes that have been pushed to the repository. Much like using Microsoft Word or Google Drive, you can have a version history of your code so that previous versions are not lost with every iteration.
> 6. **Integration options :** GitHub can integrate with common platforms such as Amazon and Google Cloud, services such as Code Climate to track your feedback, and can highlight syntax in over 200 different programming languages.
If you are working on an exciting project and you need help with software development, let us know! We would be happy to know more about it!

> 7. **Showcase your work :** Are you a developer and wishes to attract recruiters? GitHub is the best tool you can rely on for this. Today, when searching for new recruits for their project, most companies look into the GitHub profiles. If your profile is available, you will have a higher chance of being recruited even if you are not from a great university or college.

### <span style= "Color: Purple">Basic Commands to start with Github</span>

- **gitclone**

> This command is used for downloading the latest version of a remote project and copying it to the selected location on the local machine. It looks like this:

```sh
 git clone <repository url> 
 ```

- **git checkout**

> This Git command will get all the updates from the remote repository, including new branches:

```sh
 git checkout <branch name> 
 ```

- **git init**

> This is the command you need to use if you want to start a new empty repository or to reinitialize an existing one in the project root. It will create a .git directory with its subdirectories. It should look like this:

```sh
 git init <repository name>
 ```

- **git push**

> Git push will push the locally committed changes to the remote branch. If the branch is already remotely tracked, simply use it like this (with no parameters):

```sh
 git push --set-upstream <remote branch> <branch name>
 ```
